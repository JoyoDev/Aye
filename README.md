Aye is an open source tool for scanning images on Kubernetes cluster. 
It uses Anchore CLI behind the scenes to get information about all images that are currently on the cluster.
It also provides Prometheus metrics for each image, so teams are aware of 
different levels of vulnerabilities found inside them.
